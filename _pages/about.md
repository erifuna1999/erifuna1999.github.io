I'm a data scientist intern at Bold (San Mateo), who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations with tools such as Python, R, SQL, and PySpark. This portfolio contains data science projects that I completed for academic, self-learning, and exploring machine learning algorithms purposes. 

MS in Data Science at University of San Francisco.

BA in Applied Mathematics at UC Berkeley.
